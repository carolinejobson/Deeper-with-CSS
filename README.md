# Thinkful Assessment: Deeper-with-CSS

Deeper-with-CSS is a redesign of Pete-Portfolio-Thinkful, a basic, one-page website.

# Project Description

You're a web developer at the Thinkful Design Agency. Pete Thinkful, an artist, has approached your team to help him build a web portfolio to serve as his online business card.

When viewed on a desktop computer, Pete's portfolio page currently looks like this:

The designer on your team met with Pete to discuss Pete's vision for the project. Together, they redesigned the portfolio and created the following user interface mockup:

For this project, you will tweak the HTML and CSS of Pete's original portfolio site to achieve the new look and feel of the redesign.

# Redesign the Header

1. The logo text and the navigation bar should be horizontally aligned on a single row and vertically centered within the header container.

# Redesign the About Section

1. Pete's image and the Hi! I'm Pete Thinkful section should be horizontally aligned on the same row.
2. The Hi! I'm Pete Thinkful heading should be centered within the section container, and the text below should be left aligned.
3. The Pete's Background section should be displayed below Pete's image and the Hi! I'm Pete Thinkful section.

# Redesign the Portfolio Section

1. Pete's projects should be displayed on a single row, with some spacing (of your choosing) in between them.
2. The project descriptions should use a font size of 14px.
